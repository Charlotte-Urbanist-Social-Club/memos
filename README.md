# Urbanist Memoranda

We seek to gather here a collection of publications that outline urbanist theory, practices, and proposals
to improve our cities for the wellbeing and enjoyment of all denizens and visitors.
Documents published here are for the Urbanist Community at large and are open for copying with attribution without modification,
unless otherwise stated.

## Categorization
Memoranda may be published in one of the following series to help categorize an idea's level of development:

#### Requests For Comments (RFC)
Documents that seek open discussion and suggestions for improvement.

#### Experimental (EXP)
Documents that highlight new ideas and projects being tested in the world.

#### Best Current Practices (BCP)
Documents that highlight ideas and projects that have shown wide acceptance.

## Imperatives for use in memoranda to indicate requirement levels

In many documents, several words are used to signify the requirements in the specification.
These words can bring significant clarity and consistency to documents because their meanings are well defined.
This document defines how those words are interpreted in Urbanist documents when the words are in all capitals.

The words have the meanings specified herein only when they are in all capitals.
When these words are not capitalized, they have their normal English meanings and are not affected by this document.

Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with care and sparingly.
Generally, normative text does not require the use of these keywords.
They MUST only be used where it is actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has potential for causing harm.
For example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method on implementors where the method is not required.

The definitions of these terms are from [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

#### MUST
This word, or the terms "__REQUIRED__" or "__SHALL__", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

#### MUST NOT
This phrase, or the phrase "__SHALL NOT__", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.

#### SHOULD
This word, or the adjective "__RECOMMENDED__", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

#### SHOULD NOT
This phrase, or the phrase "__NOT RECOMMENDED__", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.

#### MAY
This word, or the adjective "__OPTIONAL__", mean that an item is truly optional.
One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the project while another vendor may omit the same item.
